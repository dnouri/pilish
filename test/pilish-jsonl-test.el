;;; pilish-jsonl-test.el --- Tests for JSONL session module -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Test suite for pilish-jsonl.el: JSONL session reading, raw
;; session-tree building, RPC-style display projection, and tool-call
;; preview formatting.
;;
;; Three golden fixtures under test/fixtures/ form the oracle and are
;; mutually consistent by construction (same session, same ids):
;;
;;   browse-session.jsonl   - realistic session file (header + 35 entries)
;;                            covering the full matrix: fork with a shared
;;                            toolCallId in both branches, label
;;                            set/clear/re-set, session_info x2, custom
;;                            entries (one with promoted children),
;;                            custom_message x2 (string and block content,
;;                            one with display false), aborted/no-content/
;;                            errorMessage assistants, compaction,
;;                            branch_summary, model_change,
;;                            thinking_level_change, bashExecution, user
;;                            string and block content, assistant with
;;                            read+bash+default-json tool calls plus an
;;                            unresolvable toolCallId, sibling timestamps
;;                            deliberately out of file order, and a final
;;                            label line as the raw leaf.
;;   browse-raw.json        - expected build-tree output (raw nested
;;                            :entry/:children/:label nodes, exactly the
;;                            shape of pi's get_tree before projection)
;;   browse-projected.json  - expected project-tree output (filtered nodes

;;                            previews)
;;
;; Golden comparisons canonicalize both sides through a JSON round-trip
;; (json-encode, then json-parse-string).  That makes the comparison
;; tolerant of nil-versus-:null and list-versus-vector representation on
;; the implementation side, but it still pins key order and key presence.
;;
;; Internal helper signatures pinned by the unit tables below; the green
;; implementation must provide them under the `pilish--jsonl-'
;; prefix:
;;
;;   (pilish--jsonl-extract-text CONTENT &optional MAX-LEN)
;;   (pilish--jsonl-normalize-preview TEXT)
;;   (pilish--jsonl-shorten-path PATH)
;;   (pilish--jsonl-arg-number ARGS KEY)
